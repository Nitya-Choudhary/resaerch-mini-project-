   abstract = {Fake news is a real problem in todayâ€™s world, and it has become more extensive and harder to identify. A major challenge in fake news detection is to detect it in the early phase. Another challenge in fake news detection is the unavailability or the shortage of labelled data for training the detection models. We propose a novel fake news detection framework that can address these challenges. Our proposed framework exploits the information from the news articles and the social contexts to detect fake news. The proposed model is based on a Transformer architecture, which has two parts: the encoder part to learn useful representations from the fake news data and the decoder part that predicts the future behaviour based on past observations. We also incorporate many features from the news content and social contexts into our model to help us classify the news better. In addition, we propose an effective labelling technique to address the label shortage problem. Experimental results on real-world data show that our model can detect fake news with higher accuracy within a few minutes after it propagates (early detection) than the baselines.},

   abstract = {The propagation of fake news has significant societal and economic impacts, particularly in the context of the exponential growth of digital and social media platforms. Traditional Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models, i.e., Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, have been employed to address Fake News Detection (FND) with varying degrees of success. However, these models often struggle with data dependency, overfitting, scalability, flexibility, and high computational costs. A Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) approach is proposed for Fake News Detection (ZS-FND) to address these challenges. ZSL models can predict outcomes with limited training data and do not rely on domain-specific labeled data, making them well-suited for handling fake news's diverse and evolving nature. The proposed ZS-FND model leverages the pre-trained Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) for the semantic representation of textual data and generates word vectors. ZSL considers such vectors as input for FND. The experimental results demonstrate that ZS-FND outperforms conventional ML and DL models, achieving 98.39% accuracy, 97.33% precision, 95.67% recall, 96.49% F1-score, and 0.0160 Mean Absolute Error (MAE). ZS-FND improves accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score by 10.76%, 4.05%, 5.96%, and 5.01%, respectively. These findings highlight the potential of ZSL models in providing a more robust and efficient solution for FND.},

   abstract = {As fake news spreads rapidly in social media, attempts to develop detection technology to automatically identify fake news are actively being developed, recently. However, most of them focus only on the linguistic and compositional characteristics of fake news (e.g., source or authors indication, length of a message, frequency of negative words). Compared to them, this study proposes a fake news detection model based on machine learning that reflects the characteristics of users, news content, and social networks based on social capital. To comprehensively reflect the characteristics related to the spread of fake news, this study applied the XGBoost model to estimate the feature importance of each variable to derive the priority factors that preferentially affect fake news detection. Based on the derived variables, we established SVM, RF, LR, CART, and NNET, which are representative classification models of machine learning, and compared the performance rate of fake news detection. To generalize the established models (i.e., to avoid overfitting or underfitting), this study performed a cross-validation step, and to compare the predictive accuracy of the established models. As a result, the RF model indicated the highest prediction rate at about 94%, while the NNET had the lowest performance rate at about 92.1%. The results of this study are expected to contribute to improve the fake news detection system in preparation for the more sophisticated generation and spread of fake news.},

In this paper, we describe a novel Fake News Detection system that automatically identifies whether a news item is "real" or "fake", as an extension of our work in the CONSTRAINT COVID-19 Fake News Detection in English challenge. We have used an ensemble model consisting of pre-trained models followed by a statistical feature fusion network , along with a novel heuristic algorithm by incorporating various attributes present in news items or tweets like source, username handles, URL domains and authors as statistical feature. Our proposed framework have also quantified reliable predictive uncertainty along with proper class output confidence level for the classification task. We have evaluated our results on the COVID-19 Fake News dataset and FakeNewsNet dataset to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm on detecting fake news in short news content as well as in news articles.

Current studies have made significant contributions to predicting fake news with less focus on exploiting the relationship (similarity) between the textual and visual information in news articles. Attaching importance to such similarity helps identify fake news stories that, for example, attempt to use irrelevant images to attract readers' attention. In this work, we propose a $\mathsf\{S\}$imilarity-$\mathsf\{A\}$ware $\mathsf\{F\}$ak$\mathsf\{E\}$ news detection method ($\mathsf\{SAFE\}$) which investigates multi-modal (textual and visual) information of news articles. First, neural networks are adopted to separately extract textual and visual features for news representation. We further investigate the relationship between the extracted features across modalities. Such representations of news textual and visual information along with their relationship are jointly learned and used to predict fake news. The proposed method facilitates recognizing the falsity of news articles based on their text, images, or their "mismatches."

   abstract = {In the digital age, the spread of false information has become a widespread and difficult problem. The Naive Bayes & logistic regression algorithms are used in this paper to provide a novel methodology for the detection of bogus news stories. The aim of this study is to improve the efficacy of the identification of fake news in digital material, consequently fostering information credibility and integrity within the digital ecosystem. We start this investigation by gathering a wide dataset of news articles from both reputable and phoney sources. We preprocess the textual input using techniques like tokenization, stop-word removal, and stemming to aid in feature extraction. During the feature selection phase, the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) is used to estimate the word importance of each article. Next, the Naive Bayes algorithm is used to divide news stories into two groups: phoney and real. In order to determine the probability that an article will fall into a particular category, Naive Bayes uses a probabilistic technique under the assumption that the characteristics (words) are conditionally independent. Logistic Regression models the probability of a news article being fake or genuine based on a set of relevant textual features. The primary goal of logistic regression is to achieve high accuracy in classifying news articles as fake or genuine, with an emphasis on feature engineering and model evaluation. The efficacy of the corresponding methods is determined by utilizing the confusion matrix to evaluate the correctness of the model. The findings suggest that Logistic Regression is effective in detecting fake news and contributes to the trustworthiness of information sources in the digital age.},

We first leverage the graph theory-based spectral clustering approach to obtain the center-of-mass vectors and entropies to capture the complex associations and implicit evidences among the news on social media. Then, we introduce a shared parameter multitask learning framework that treats different news environments as independent tasks and architects GRU bootstrapping modules with attention mechanisms to help aggregate features from different environments efficiently and interpretably. Finally, we provide textual perspective and stylistic perspective approaches during the detection process and soften the loss terms in multiple environments to alleviate the strict constraints, thus making it more compatible with the fake news detection task. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, the SEAFND method improves the detection performance by 1%-2% on the multidomain datasets Ch-9 and En-3.},

However, fake news is increasingly appearing on social media, and it is not always possible for people to obtain correct news from partial news pages or short Twitter posts. Understanding whether the news shared on Twitter is true or not is an important problem. Detecting fake tweets is of great importance in Turkish as well as in any language. In this study, fake news obtained from verification platforms on Twitter and real news obtained from the Twitter accounts of mainstream newspapers were labeled and, preprocessed using the Zemberek natural language processing tool developed for the Turkish language, and a dataset named TR_FaRe_News was created. Then, the TR_FaRe_News dataset was explored using ensemble methods and BoW, TF-IDF, and Word2Vec vectorization methods for fake news detection. Then a pre-trained BERT deep learning model was fine-tuned, and variations of the model extended with Bi-LSTM and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) layers with the frozen and unfrozen parameters methods were explored. The performance evaluation was conducted using seven comparable datasets, namely BuzzFeedNews, GossipCop, ISOT, LIAR, Twitter15, and Twitter16, including an LLM-generated fake news dataset.

By analyzing factors such as transaction timing, store location, product type, and day of the week, this research aims to uncover patterns that can enhance inventory management and customer engagement. The Random Forest model was evaluated through cross-validation, yielding a mean Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 80.97, which indicates moderate predictive accuracy and represents an improvement over traditional forecasting methods commonly employed in the industry. Feature importance analysis revealed that Premium Beans is the most influential predictor, followed by seasonal trends (month), time of day, and weekend sales patterns.
